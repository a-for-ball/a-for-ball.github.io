        <h2>1. Sales Success Prediction</h2>
        <p>Performed end-to-end analysis of sales data using Python and Power BI to predict sales outcomes and uncover actionable business insights.</p>
        <p><strong>ABC Pvt. Ltd.</strong> (name anonymized) offers a Dual Fuel System for diesel generators, which allows operation using both diesel and natural gas for better efficiency and compliance.</p>
        <p>The focus area was NCR, where pollution-driven restrictions impact demand. This solution targeted industrial and commercial facilities seeking cleaner energy alternatives during high-pollution months.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seasonal trends impact sales volume (notably Q2).</li>
            <li>Locations like Noida and Faridabad consistently outperform.</li>
            <li>Sales success doesn't scale directly with kVA ratings—client profile and regulations play key roles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Model Performance:</strong><br>
            Among six models tested, the best achieved an ROC-AUC score of ~0.73. Feature importance analysis emphasized the role of 'Location', 'Client Type', and 'Rating per kVA' in driving conversions.

        <h2>2. SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis & Prediction</h2>
        <p>Analyzed SpaceX Falcon 9 missions using Python, Plotly Dash, and scikit-learn to explore launch behavior and predict landing outcomes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>KSC LC-39A emerges as the most successful launch site.</li>
            <li>Lower payloads are strongly associated with successful landings.</li>
            <li>Orbits such as GEO, HEO, SSO, and ES-L1 achieved 100% success rates in the dataset.</li>
            <li>Launch sites are strategically positioned near coastlines and close to the equator.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN models.</li>
            <li>Logistic Regression and SVM both achieved test accuracies of ~83%.</li>
            <li>Cross-validation confirmed ~80% average accuracy, ensuring model reliability.</li>
            <li>Confusion matrix highlights strong performance by Logistic Regression with very few false negatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
            Landing outcome prediction is highly feasible using publicly available data. Launch cost estimation is also possible to a certain degree using features like orbit type and payload mass.
